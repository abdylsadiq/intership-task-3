This SQL project focuses on querying and analyzing data from two tables: products and customers. The aim is to demonstrate the use of core SQL operations such as selecting data, filtering based on conditions, and sorting results. Through this project, we explore how to retrieve meaningful insights from raw data using SQL queries.
